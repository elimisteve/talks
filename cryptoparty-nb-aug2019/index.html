## Our Mass Surveillance Situation

- Your **cell carrier** (e.g., AT&T) and some apps know where you are

- **Facebook** knows who your friends are, who you message

- **Gmail/Yahoo/Microsoft** knows who you email and what you say

- **Google** knows what you search for/think about

- **Dropbox** has your personal files and data

- **Skype** knows what you look and sound like

---

## Good thing all that information is separate!

Or is it?

(Facebook tracks _and buys_ info)

---

## What the NSA knows

---

## What does all this add up to?

Snowden, in an interview:

- "**You could read anyone's email in the world**, anybody you've got an email address for. Any website: You can watch traffic to and from it. Any computer that an individual sits at: You can watch it."

## MLK

## "But why worry about privacy if I'm not an activist?"

- Maybe your friend is an effective activist

- A WikiLeaks' associates phone was confiscated, now some of his contacts get stopped at the border
  - http://www.cnet.com/news/security-researcher-i-keep-getting-detained-by-feds/

---

## WikiLeaks, Twitter, and Me

- The US gov't has requested _my_ data from Twitter in 2011
  - ...and the data of every other WikiLeaks follower

- Because **our government considers following WikiLeaks on Twitter to be a suspicious act**

---

## Stingrays

- Fake cell phone tower
  - Used by LAPD, others
  - See https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-cell-phone-surveillance-transparency-law-20170827-htmlstory.html

  - ...unless you use encryption

---

## "But I'm not doing anything wrong"

- Freeing slaves

- Teaching black people how to read

- Interracial sex (used to be illegal)

- LGBTQIA+ relationships

---

## "But I'm not doing anything wrong" (2)

- What about Bernie Sanders-type figures in 30 years?

- During WWII, an LA church housed Japanese

---

## Surveillance and Terrorism

- Mass surveillance have never prevented any terrorist action
  - 9/11
  - Boston Bombing
  - etc

- For more of my comments on the (in)effectiveness of mass surveillance, listen to Episode 1 of "The Populist Papers"
  - <https://soundcloud.com/user-497344499/populistpaperse1>

## 2FA

Snowden mentions the importance of 2FA at
https://boingboing.net/2015/11/12/edward-snowdens-operational.html

> Much of Snowden's advice takes the form of simple self-help measures
> (use Tor Browser for sensitive lookups: think about where you take
> your phone; encrypt your calls and messages with the easy-to-use
> Signal; turn on two-factor authentication where it's available).
