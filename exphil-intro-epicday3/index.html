## What is Executable Philosophy?

Steven D. Phillips

2015.10.18

Epic Day #3 with Gabrielle Molina

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Talk Outline

- 3 problems with how Philosophy is done today

- Solution to all of them

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## What's Wrong With Philosophy?

1. It's ambiguous

2. Often claims things exist that might not

3. We ignore every branch we're not working in

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Example of Modern Philosophy

> By a "denoting phrase" I mean a phrase such as any one of the
following: a man, some man, any man, every man, all men, the present
King of England, the present King of France, the centre of mass of the
Solar System at the first instant of the twentieth century, the
revolution of the earth round the sun, the revolution of the sun round
the earth.  Thus a phrase is denoting solely in virtue of its _form_.

--Bertrand Russell (Nobel Prize-winning philosopher)

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Are These Denoting Phrases?

- "My shoe"
  - Doesn't exactly match the form of any examples

- "A the"
  - Isn't grammatical

It makes sense to debate what Russell's theory says in these
situations, because it isn't clear.

This problem also occurs with people trying to deny absurd
consequences of their theories.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Problem #1 (with Philosophy): Ambiguity

Russell's description of his theory of denoting is ambiguous.  But how
specific is specific enough?

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Problem #2: Indefensible Existence Claims

Philosophers claim the existence of many things that I don't think we
can ever have evidence of, and therefore cannot defend the existence
of.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Strange Things Philosophers Believe In

1. Numbers, lines, and circles in Platonic heaven

2. References between words and objects

3. Moral facts independent of human psychology or evolution

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Why Do They Believe In Such Things?

Because they think we have to!  To explain:

1. How we know about numbers, lines, circles, etc without ever
experiencing them

2. How language works/the meanings of words

3. The obvious fact that murder is immoral

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Do We _Need_ To Claim These Things Exist?

Is it possible to explain these phemonema without positing non-spatial
places (like Platonic heaven), references as kind of like objects, and
strong moral sentiments?

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to definitively show, one way or the
other, whether or not we need these things to exist?

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Problem #3: Ignoring Other Branches of Philosophy

When working on one branch of Philosophy, philosophers make naive
assumptions about all the other branches, either consciously or
unconsciously.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Incompatible Assumptions?

Example: ethics thought experiments commonly begin with something
like, "suppose 2 runaway trolley cars take off simultaneously in
opposite directions..."

Subtle problem: Einstein's special relativity tells us that there is
no such thing as absolute simultaneity -- it's not physically
possible!  (Must specify reference frame.)

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Too Complex

But it's not their fault; it's too complicated to factor in all of
Philosophy when doing any Philosophy.

If only we could automatically detect inconsistencies in our claims
and beliefs...

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## The Solution to Problems 1, 2, 3, and more: Executable Philosophy

- Idea: let's do Philosophy, not in a _natural_ language (like English), but in a _programming_ language

- Executable Philosophy ("ExPhil" for short)
  - Create Philosophy you can execute like a computer program

- Construct philosophical theories, ideas, and objects _in software_

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## ExPhil (continued)

- All terminology is defined _and well-defined_
- Compute facts about the logical repercussions of our beliefs
  - What exists, philosophical theories, and scientific theories

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## What Executable Philosophy Looks Like

```
def is_even(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False


print is_even(4)  # True
print is_even(5)  # False
```

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Another ExPhil Example

```
def is_a_denoting_phrase(phrase):
    # Example input: "Some man"

    words = phrase.split()
    # words == ["Some", "man"]

    if len(words) == 0:
        return False

    if words[0].lower() in ["a", "some", "any", "every", "all"]:
        return True

    # TODO: Do more advanced checks here.  Check to see if
    # second word is a noun?
    return False
```

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## is_a_denoting_phrase (continued)

```
print is_a_denoting_phrase("Some man")  # True
print is_a_denoting_phrase("My shoe")   # False
print is_a_denoting_phrase("A the")     # True. Check for nouns?
print is_a_denoting_phrase("A")         # False. Bug?
```

We compute facts based upon what we said we mean by each of our terms.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Solving Problem #1: Ambiguity/Specificity

Specific enough: an algorithm implemented (typically as a function) in
a programming language (such as Python), as seen above.

Debating what a philosophical theory says in a given situation -- that
is, what a function returns as output when given a certain input --
will simply end.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Solving Problem #2: Indefensible Existence Claims

Do you _need_ to claim that numbers, lines, circles, references, and
moral facts exist?  Prove it!

Opponents can try to explain the desired phenomena _without_ claiming
those things exist.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Solving Problem #3: Ignoring Other Branches

```
import exphil.objects

from exphil.theories.physics import einsteinian

trolley1 = exphil.objects.TrolleyCar()
trolley2 = exphil.objects.TrolleyCar()

world = einsteinian.simultaneous(trolley1, {"direction": 1},
                                 trolley2, {"direction": -1})
```

The last line throws an error and stops executing (didn't add
`reference_frame=0`, the rest frame).

The creator of this program didn't have to understand his/her own
mistake; ExPhil told him/her about it.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Comparison with The Current State of Philosophy

Imagine if mathematicians had never defined their terms!  Rigorous
math couldn't have even have started!  No axioms, proofs, no theorems
-- nothing.

Philosophy has _almost_ begun.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Other Applications of ExPhil

- New Field: Computational Law
  - Automate lawyers away?

- New Field: Rigoristics

- Belief recommendation for all
